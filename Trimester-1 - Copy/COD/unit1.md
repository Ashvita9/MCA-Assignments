## Basics of Digital Electronics

### Q1: What are the two main types of digital circuits? 
A1: The two main types of digital circuits are combinational digital circuits and sequential digital circuits.

### Q2: What is the key difference between combinational and sequential circuits?
A2: In combinational circuits, the output depends only on the current input values. In sequential circuits, the output depends on both the current input values and previous input values (stored in memory elements).

### Q3: What is the function of a half-adder?
A3: A half-adder performs the basic binary addition operation on two bits, producing a sum and a carry-out.

### Q4: How does a full-adder differ from a half-adder?
A4: A full-adder has three inputs (A, B, and Carry-in) compared to the two inputs of a half-adder. It can handle carry-in from previous additions, making it suitable for multi-bit addition.

### Q5: What is the purpose of a multiplexer?
A5: A multiplexer selects one of several input signals and passes it on to the output based on the select lines.

### Q6: How does a demultiplexer function?
A6: A demultiplexer takes data from one line and distributes it to one of several output lines based on the select lines. It essentially reverses the multiplexing function.

### Q7: What is the role of an encoder?
A7: An encoder converts a set of input lines, where only one is active at a time, into a binary code representing the active input.

### Q8: How does a decoder operate?
A8: A decoder takes a binary number as input and activates the corresponding output line, effectively decoding the binary input.

## Registers and Microoperations

### Q9: What is the fundamental building block of a register?
A9: Flip-flops are the fundamental building blocks of registers, capable of storing one bit of data each.

* Parallel-In Serial-Out (PISO)
* Parallel-In Parallel-Out (PIPO)

### Q11: What are the primary applications of shift registers?

## General Concepts

### Q28: What is the difference between a latch and a flip-flop?
A28: A latch is level-sensitive, meaning its output changes as long as the enable input is active. A flip-flop is edge-triggered, meaning its output changes only at the active edge (rising or falling) of the clock signal.

### Q29: What is the significance of the control function in register transfers?
A29: The control function acts like an "if" statement, allowing a register transfer to occur only if a certain condition is met (i.e., the control signal is 1).

### Q30: What are the advantages of using a bus in digital systems?
A30: A bus provides a shared communication pathway between multiple components, reducing the number of wires needed and simplifying the system's design. 

## Sequential Circuits

### Q31: What is the main characteristic of sequential circuits that distinguishes them from combinational circuits?
A31: The main characteristic of sequential circuits is that their output depends not only on the present inputs but also on the past sequence of inputs, which is stored in memory elements.

### Q32: What are the two common types of latches used in sequential circuits?
A32: The two common types of latches are SR (Set-Reset) latch and D (Data or Delay) latch.

### Q33: What is the undesirable state in an SR latch and how is it addressed in a D latch?
A33: The undesirable state in an SR latch occurs when both S and R inputs are 1, leading to an unpredictable output. The D latch addresses this by ensuring that S and R are never 1 at the same time.

### Q34: What are the different types of flip-flops commonly used in digital systems?

### Q44: How do data hazards impact pipelining and how can they be mitigated?
A44: Data hazards can cause stalls or incorrect results in pipelining. They can be mitigated using techniques like forwarding (bypassing) or stalling the pipeline.

### Q45: What are the implications of instruction hazards on instruction sets?
A45: Instruction hazards can influence instruction set design by favoring instructions that minimize dependencies or providing mechanisms to handle branches efficiently.

## Memory Hierarchy

### Q46: What is the concept of memory hierarchy in computer systems?
A46: Memory hierarchy is a concept where different types of memory (registers, cache, main memory, secondary storage) are organized in a hierarchical manner based on speed, size, and cost.

### Q47: Why is there a speed gap between processor and memory, and how does cache memory address this?
